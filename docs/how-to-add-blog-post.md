# üìù How to Add a Blog Post

1. Create a new `.mdx` file in the `/posts` directory.
2. Add frontmatter at the top:
   ```mdx
   ---
   title: "Your Post Title"
   description: "Short summary of your post."
   date: "YYYY-MM-DD"
   tags: ["tag1", "tag2"]
   ---
   ```
3. Write your content in Markdown or MDX (you can use React components).
4. Save the file. It will automatically appear on the blog page after redeploying or running the dev server.
